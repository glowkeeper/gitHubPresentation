## What is GitHub?

Hosts _git_ repositories

## What is git?

Distributed (source code) _version control_ - people work locally, then push and pull changes to and from GitHub

## What is Version Control?

+ Which _changes_ were made?
+ Who made the _changes_?
+ When were the _changes_ made?
+ Why were _changes_ needed?

## Goals

1. Manage _change_ (versioning)
2. Collaboration
4. Archive

Before you do _ANYTHING_ else:

**Pull**

(or know why not to **Pull**)

## Adding Files (to GitHub)

1. Stage
2. Commit
3. **Push**

## Pull Requests

Tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub
